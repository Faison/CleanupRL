# CleanupRL
Cleanup the house for a week in this Roguelike or you can't go to the Fair - 7DRL Game

## Dev Guidelines
* Each playthrough lasts a week, with a reward a kid would like at the end
* Each level is a day in the week, each one with more chores and more messy rooms
* The player needs to Cleanup the house and complete chores before parents get home
* The player should have opportunities for shortcuts, but there's a chance of backfire
* The player should be distracted from chores by other things that make more work for the player
* If the player has a dog, it must be taken for a walk at least once a day
* This game should be easily ported to a board game with a small amount of tokens
